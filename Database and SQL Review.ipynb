    "- An ORDER BY command cannot be used in a subquery, although the main query can use an ORDER BY. The GROUP BY command can be used to perform the same function as the ORDER BY in a subquery.\n",
    "- Subqueries that return more than one row can only be used with multiple value operators such as the IN operator.\n",
    "- The SELECT list cannot include any references to values that evaluate to a BLOB, ARRAY, CLOB, or NCLOB.\n",
    "- A subquery cannot be immediately enclosed in a set function.\n",
